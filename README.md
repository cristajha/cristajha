Here at NC Bagel, we begin each morning at the crack of dawn, slicing fresh vegetables,baking NY style; Kettle cooked bagels, making fresh assorted cream cheeses and whipping up our French toast batter from scratch. Everything is made to order, and freshness is never compromised. NC Bagel is a full breakfast restaurant. We don’t use heat lamps or deep fryers — we use only the finest ingredients possible for the freshest taste around. We use shell eggs and all breakfast items are made to order.
